# 🎯 CartPole - Deep Q-Network (DQN) Agent

This project implements a **Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent to solve the classic **CartPole-v1** environment using **PyTorch** and **OpenAI Gym**. The agent learns to balance a pole on a cart by interacting with the environment and maximizing cumulative rewards over episodes.

## 🧠 Algorithm: Deep Q-Network (DQN)

DQN combines **Q-learning** with **deep neural networks** and uses a **replay buffer** for stable learning.

### Key Components:

- **Experience Replay:** Stores past experiences and samples random batches to break correlations.
- **Target Network:** A copy of the Q-network that is updated periodically for more stable targets.
- **Epsilon-Greedy Policy:** Balances exploration and exploitation.

## ⚙️ How to Train the Agent

> 🐍 Make sure you're in the `dqn_cartpole` conda environment.

```bash
python train.py
This script will:

Train the DQN agent on CartPole-v1

Save the model as checkpoint.pth

Save training plot as training_plot.png

🎥 Evaluate and Record Video
To generate a video of the trained agent:

bash
Copy
Edit
python -c "from video_utils import record_video; record_video('CartPole-v1', 'checkpoint.pth')"
Video will be saved as cartpole_output.mp4.

📊 Example Result
✅ Solved: Average reward ≥ 195
🏁 Final performance: ~197 average reward

🛠️ Dependencies
Install via conda or pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install torch gym[classic_control] matplotlib numpy
